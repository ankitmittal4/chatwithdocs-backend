6.PROCEDURE: 
 
• Switch off the ACB/VCB by using the manual trip mechanism or the electrical control switch. 
• Ensure the power supply to the breaker is turned off 
• Isolate the feeder circuit to which the ACB/VCB is connected 
• Place a lockout device on the breaker and associated disconnecting switch to prevent accidental re-
energization. 
• Place a warning tag indicating the breaker is under maintenance. 
• Confirm zero energy state at all points before starting maintenance work. 
• Check for physical damage, cracks, or signs of overheating on the breaker housing, covers, and 
components. 
• Check for any corrosion, loose connections, or overheating signs at the terminals and bus bars. 
• Clean terminals with non-conductive tools and check the tightness of connections. 
• Apply an anti-corrosive compound if necessary, to ensure good contact. 
• Ensure there is no dust, dirt, or moisture buildup on or around the ACB/VCB. 
• Clean the area using a soft cloth or compressed air. 
• Check the operating mechanism for smooth movement and correct alignment 
• Look for any signs of binding or wear in the mechanism, such as the springs, pins, and levers. 
• Lubricate moving parts as per the manufacturer’s recommendations (e.g., operating springs). 
• Inspect the main contacts, arcing contacts (for ACBs), and vacuum interrupters (for VCBs Inspect the 
vacuum interrupter for cracks or damage that might lead to leakage) for any signs of wear, pitting, or 
discoloration. 
• Clean contacts if necessary, using dry clothes or contact cleaner (avoid abrasives that could damage 
surfaces). 
• Ensure contacts are properly aligned and free from any obstructions. 
• Ensure the trip mechanism operates correctly and verify that there are no sticking parts or corrosion. 
• Manually test the trip function (not involving live circuits). 
• Check the auxiliary contacts for wear or damage. 
• Clean any dust or debris from auxiliary contacts. 
6.OH&S AND ENVIRONMENT HAZARDS 
OH&S Hazards: 
1. CONTROL MEASURES IN 
OPERATION: 
The most common hazards are: 
• Falls on Same Level  
• Slippery surface 
• Exposure to respiratory system 
• Exposure to High-Frequency Sound Waves 
• Electric Shock 
The control measures in Operation are: 
• Wear arc flash-rated PPE (face 
shields, suits, gloves). 
• Ensure proper training for personnel 
in handling electrical hazards. 
• Perform regular maintenance checks 
to identify faulty equipment. 
• Use proper insulation and 
grounding. 
 
Environment Hazards:   Control Measures in Operation: 
• Land contamination 
• Preventive Maintenance of 
ACB/VCB as per SAP scheduling

• Inspect all auxiliary relays and control circuits for proper connection and operational integrity. 
• Verify that the shunt trip, under-voltage release, and other auxiliary components are functioning 
correctly. 
• Tighten any screws or bolts that were loosened during maintenance 
• Once the maintenance is complete and all checks have been performed, remove the lockout/tagout 
devices in accordance with your facility’s procedures. 
• Reconnect the ACB/VCB to the power supply 
• close the breaker and verify normal operation, ensuring that there are no unusual sounds or 
behaviours. 
• Perform a final visual inspection to ensure everything is in place 
 
7.ENVIRONMENTAL INSTRUCTIONS / CONSIDERATIONS 
 
Prevention of waste contamination of ground and water courses/ Arrest Spillages:  
 
• Any damaged or worn components, such as contacts, seals, or insulating materials, should be properly 
disposed of in accordance with local environmental regulations. 
• Recyclable materials, such as metals or plastics, should be separated from hazardous waste for recycling. 
• Avoid spillage of these substances during maintenance and use appropriate spill containment 
procedures if needed. 
 
Dealing with waste:  
• When cleaning finishes, always ensure that wastes are not left on floor but cleaned up immediately with 
water if it is reusable and not left for someone to clean. 
• Always leave the area clean after work completion.
