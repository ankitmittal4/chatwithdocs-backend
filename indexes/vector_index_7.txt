ACB/VCB Maintenance 
Linked to Risk Assessment:  Yes Location: Plant 
 
1.PURPOSE:  
To define the standard process for safely and effectively removing and replacing the position transducer on a 
hydraulic cylinder, ensuring continued accuracy in the hydraulic system's operation 
2.SCOPE:  
This SOP applies to all personnel who perform maintenance or replacement of the position transducer installed on 
hydraulic cylinders in industrial and operational settings. It includes the procedures for isolation, removal, installation 
of a new transducer, and post-installation testing. 
4.RESPONSIBILITY: 
The following employees are responsible to implement this procedure while working on removing and replacing the 
position transducer-

6.PROCEDURE: 
 
• Turn off power to the hydraulic system to ensure the system is completely de-energized. 
• Use Lockout/Tagout (LOTO) procedures to ensure the system cannot be inadvertently 
activated during PT change. 
• Release any stored hydraulic pressure from the hydraulic valve to avoid potential hazards 
when removing the position transducer. 
• Verify that all hydraulic lines are depressurized, and that the system is fully isolated from both 
power and pressure. 
• Remove all pipelines from the cylinder to ensure safe access to the position transducer. 
• Lift the cylinder using a chain pulley and securely hold it on a stand to ensure stability during 
maintenance. 
• Remove the fuse of the position transducer from the panel to disconnect the power supply. 
• Carefully disconnect the wiring or electrical connectors from the position transducer, ensuring 
no damage to the wiring. 
• Remove the position transducer from the cylinder and install the new position transducer, 
ensuring proper alignment and secure attachment. 
• Reconnect the electrical wiring or connectors to the new position transducer, ensuring all 
connections are secure and free of corrosion. 
• Fix the cylinder back to its correct position, ensuring it is securely mounted. 
• Reconnect all hose pipes to the hydraulic cylinder, ensuring all connections are tight and leak-
free. 
• Restore power to the hydraulic system and remove Lockout/Tagout (LOTO) devices. 
• Restore the power to the position transducer by reinserting the fuses. 
 
6.OH&S AND ENVIRONMENT HAZARDS 
OH&S Hazards: 
1. CONTROL MEASURES IN 
OPERATION: 
The most common hazards are: 
• Falls on Same Level  
• Slippery surface 
• Exposure to respiratory system 
• Electric Shock 
The control measures in Operation are: 
• Wear arc flash-rated PPE (face 
shields, suits, gloves). 
• Ensure proper training for personnel 
in handling electrical hazards. 
• Perform regular maintenance checks 
to identify faulty equipment. 
• Use proper insulation and 
grounding. 
 
Environment Hazards:   Control Measures in Operation: 
• Land contamination 
• removing and replacing the position 
transducer

• Perform a final operational check of the hydraulic system, ensuring that the cylinder operation 
is correct and that the position transducer is providing accurate feedback to the control system. 
 
7.ENVIRONMENTAL INSTRUCTIONS / CONSIDERATIONS 
 
Prevention of waste contamination of ground and water courses/ Arrest Spillages:  
 
• Any damaged or worn components, such as contacts, seals, or insulating materials, should be properly 
disposed of in accordance with local environmental regulations. 
• Recyclable materials, such as metals or plastics, should be separated from hazardous waste for recycling. 
• Avoid spillage of these substances during maintenance and use appropriate spill containment 
procedures if needed. 
 
Dealing with waste:  
• When cleaning finishes, always ensure that wastes are not left on floor but cleaned up immediately with 
water if it is reusable and not left for someone to clean. 
• Always leave the area clean after work completion. 
 
 
 
 
8.DOCUMENTATION & ENCLOSURES: 
 
• No enclosures
